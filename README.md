This repository will have most of the projects that I do due to my university courses and will most likely all be in C++.
This sub-branch contain all files necessary to run the amode beamforming.
This program uses echos from an ultrasound array transducer and generates a scanline.
Running the main file, it will ask for the depth of the scan and then how many pixel before exporting the results to an externale file.
The external file can then be graphed in excel and to show the scanline.
